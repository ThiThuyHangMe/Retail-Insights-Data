## Overview
This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides comprehensive insights into sales performance and customer behavior. The dataset was cleaned in Excel, analysed in SQL, and visualised using Power BI. The dashboard offers key metrics on sales trends, product categories, customer demographics, and order processing times, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

## Data Sources
The dataset comes from company sales records, including information on sales transactions, customer demographics, product categories, and order processing data.

## Data Cleaning in Excel
- The raw data contained inconsistencies such as duplicate entries, missing values, and improperly formatted fields. Excel was used for:    
    + Removing duplicates to ensure unique customer and sales data.
    + Handling missing values by filling in gaps with averages or removing irrelevant entries.
    + Standardising date formats and normalising numerical fields such as sales and profits, ensuring the data was clean and ready for analysis.
## SQL for In-Depth Analysis
- After cleaning, the data was imported into a SQL database for deeper analysis. SQL allowed us to:
    + Aggregate data by calculating total sales, profit, and orders by year, product category, and customer segment.
    + Segment customers based on purchase behavior, such as frequency and recency of orders.
    + Perform complex queries to calculate KPIs such as total units sold, average order value, and profit margins, providing a detailed view of business performance.
## Power BI for Visualisation
- The cleaned and analysed data was then imported into Power BI for creating dynamic and interactive visualisations. Power BI enabled us to:
    + Create key visuals such as bar charts, pie charts, and KPIs for easy interpretation of sales and customer metrics.
    + Set up filters and slicers to allow users to drill down by year, product category, and customer demographics.
    + Design a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for stakeholders to explore key data points and generate insights.
